alias: alias
        Define or Display aliases.

        Without arguments, 'alias' prints the list of aliases in the reusable
       form 'alias NAME=VALUE' on standard output.

       Otherwise, an alias is defined for each NAME whose value is given.
       A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked for
      substituation when the alias is expanded.

      Options:
            NONE
      Exit Status:
      alias returns true unless a NAME is supplied for which no alias has been
       deined.
